## ContractorLogin Function

### Purpose and Description
The `ContractorLogin` function renders a form that allows a user to log in as either a contractor or a worker. The form consists of two dropdowns, one for selecting a contractor and one for selecting a worker. There is also a login button that, when clicked, attempts to log the user in as the selected contractor and worker.

### Parameters and their Types

The `ContractorLogin` function does not take any parameters.

### Return Value and Type

The `ContractorLogin` function returns a JSX element that represents the login form.

### Usage Examples

The `ContractorLogin` function can be used in a React application as follows:

```tsx
import ContractorLogin from "./ContractorLogin";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ContractorLogin />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Important Notes
The `ContractorLogin` function uses the `workerLogin` function from the `server/login` module to attempt to log the user in. The `workerLogin` function takes two parameters, `contractor` and `worker`, which are the names of the contractor and worker that the user is attempting to log in as. The `workerLogin` function returns a promise that resolves to an object with two properties, `status` and `message`. The `status` property will be either "success" or "error", and the `message` property will contain a message describing the result of the login attempt.

If the `workerLogin` function returns a status of "success", the `ContractorLogin` function will use the `useRouter` hook from the `routing` module to navigate to the "/Worker" page. If the `workerLogin` function returns a status of "error", the `ContractorLogin` function will display an alert message with the error message.
