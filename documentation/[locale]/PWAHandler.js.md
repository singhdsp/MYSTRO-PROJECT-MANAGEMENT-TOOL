## Function: PWAHandler

### Purpose
Registers a service worker in the browser if the browser supports service workers.

### Description
The `PWAHandler` function uses the `useEffect` hook to register a service worker in the browser. It checks if the `serviceWorker` property exists in the `navigator` object and if so, registers a service worker at the `/sw.js` URL. If the service worker registration is successful, it logs the scope of the service worker to the console.

### Parameters
None

### Return Value
The function returns `null` because the component it is used in doesn't render anything.

### Usage Examples
```typescript
import PWAHandler from './PWAHandler';

const MyComponent = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    PWAHandler();
  }, []);

  return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
};

export default MyComponent;
```

### Important Notes
- The service worker file `/sw.js` should be created and placed in the root of the web application.
- The service worker registration process may take some time, so it's recommended to handle it in a separate `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array to avoid unnecessary re-registrations.
- The scope of the service worker, logged to the console, indicates the URLs that the service worker will control.
- If the browser doesn't support service workers, the registration process will fail and nothing will be logged to the console.
