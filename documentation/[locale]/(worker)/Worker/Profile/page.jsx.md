## Profile Component
### Purpose and Description
The `Profile` component in this code snippet is a React functional component used to render a profile page for a user. It displays the user's profile picture, full name, and options for changing the language and logging out. When the user clicks the logout button, it calls the `logout` function to log the user out and redirect them to the home page.

### Parameters
The `Profile` component does not take any parameters.

### Return Value and Type
The `Profile` component returns a JSX element that represents the profile page. The element consists of two sections: one for the desktop view and one for the mobile view. The desktop view includes a profile picture, full name, and options for changing the language and logging out. The mobile view displays a message indicating that this part of the site is under development and asks the user to switch to the mobile screen using Chrome Dev Tools.

### Usage Examples
The following code shows an example of how to use the `Profile` component:
```
import Profile from './Profile';

function App() {
  return (
    <Profile />
  );
}
```

### Important Notes
- The `Profile` component uses the `useTranslations` hook to access the internationalized strings for the profile page.
- The `Profile` component uses the `getUser` function to fetch the user's information from the server.
- The `Profile` component uses the `logout` function to log the user out and redirect them to the home page.
