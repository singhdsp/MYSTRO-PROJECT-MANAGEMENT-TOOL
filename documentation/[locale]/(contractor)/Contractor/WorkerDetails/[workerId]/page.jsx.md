## Function Purpose and Description

The `Page` function is a React component responsible for displaying detailed information about a worker, including their attendance, task history, and the ability to edit their dollar rate and notes. It allows users to review a worker's day, week, and last week's performance, and make necessary updates to their financial information.

## Parameters and Their Types

The `Page` function does not take any parameters.

## Return Value and Type

The `Page` function returns a JSX element representing the worker details page.

## Usage Examples

```javascript
import Page from "./Page.js";

const WorkerDetailsPage = () => {
  return (
    <Page />
  );
};

export default WorkerDetailsPage;
```

## Important Notes

* The `Page` function uses the `useEffect` hook to fetch worker data based on the selected date, which is controlled by a date picker.
* The component also utilizes the `resetTimeToStartOfDay` helper function to ensure that the worker data is retrieved for the correct day when the date is changed.
* The `getStartOfWeek` and `getEndOfLastWeek` helper functions are used to calculate the start and end of the current and previous weeks, respectively, for displaying weekly task hours.
* The component uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of various elements, such as the worker data, selected date, and loading status.
* The `saveNotesRate` function is used to update the worker's notes and dollar rate.
* The `useNotyf` hook is employed to display notifications to the user.
