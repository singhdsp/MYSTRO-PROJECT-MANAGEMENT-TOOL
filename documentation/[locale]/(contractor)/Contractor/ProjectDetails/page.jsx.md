## ProjectDetails Function

### Purpose
The `ProjectDetails` function is responsible for displaying the details of a specific project, including its name, tasks, and status. It allows the user to navigate between projects, filter tasks by status, and create or edit tasks.

### Description
The function uses the `useEffect` hook to fetch the project data from the server upon mounting and whenever the selected date changes. It then uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the project data, including the current project index, task status, and selected date. The function also uses the `useTranslations` hook to retrieve localized strings from the `ContractorProjectDetails1` namespace.

### Parameters
The function does not take any parameters.

### Return Value
The function returns a React component that displays the project details.

### Usage Examples
```jsx
import ProjectDetails from 'path/to/ProjectDetails';

const Page = () => {
  return (
    <ProjectDetails />
  );
};
```

### Important Notes
- The function relies on the `getTasksWithStatus` function, which is responsible for fetching the project data from the server.
- The function uses the `Skeleton` component to display a skeleton loading state while the project data is being fetched.
- The function uses the `DatePicker` and `SelectStatus` components to allow the user to filter the project data.
- The function uses the `TaskList` component to display the tasks for the current project.
- The function uses the `Link` component to allow the user to create or edit tasks.
