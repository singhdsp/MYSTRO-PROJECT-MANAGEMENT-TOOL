### CommentBox

The CommentBox component in this React application is used to render a form that allows users to post comments, upload images, and record audio. It also displays a list of existing comments for a specific task.

**Purpose and Description**

The purpose of the `CommentBox` is to provide a user interface for commenting on tasks, adding attachments, and facilitating user interaction. It displays the profile picture, full name, total hours, and hours worked today for a particular worker assigned to a task. Users can add comments, upload images, record and submit audio comments, and delete their own comments.

**Parameters and their types**

The `CommentBox` component takes the following props:

- `worker`: Object containing the worker's information, including `id`, `fullName`, `photoURL`, and `comments`.
- `taskId`: String representing the ID of the task for which comments are being displayed.
- `taskHours`: Array containing task hours for the worker.
- `setRefreshing`: Function that updates the state to trigger a refresh of the comments list.
- `refreshing`: Current state of the comment list.

**Return Value and Type**

- The `CommentBox` component returns a JSX element representing the comment form and the list of existing comments.

**Usage Examples**

```javascript
import CommentBox from "./CommentBox";

const taskHours = [
  {
    id: 1,
    userId: 1,
    taskId: 2,
    date: "2023-03-08",
    hours: 8,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    userId: 1,
    taskId: 2,
    date: "2023-03-09",
    hours: 4,
  },
];

const worker = {
  id: 1,
  fullName: "John Doe",
  photoURL: "/john-doe.jpg",
  comments: [],
};

const setRefreshing = (value) => {
  // Update the state to trigger a refresh of the comments list.
};

const refreshing = false;

const CommentBoxExample = () => {
  return (
    <CommentBox
      worker={worker}
      taskId="2"
      taskHours={taskHours}
      setRefreshing={setRefreshing}
      refreshing={refreshing}
    />
  );
};

export default CommentBoxExample;
```
