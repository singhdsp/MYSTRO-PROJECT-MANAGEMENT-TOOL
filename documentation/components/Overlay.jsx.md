## Overlay Component

### Purpose and Description

The `Overlay` component is a reusable modal that can be used to display content on top of the current page. It supports controlled visibility through the `isOpen` prop, allowing developers to show or hide the modal as needed. The content to be displayed within the modal is provided as the `children` prop.

### Parameters and Types

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `isOpen` | `boolean` | Controls the visibility of the modal. Set to `true` to show the modal, `false` to hide it. |
| `setIsOpen` | `(isOpen: boolean) => void` | A callback function to update the `isOpen` state and control the visibility of the modal. |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | The content to be displayed within the modal. |

### Return Value and Type

The `Overlay` component returns a `ReactNode` representing the modal.

### Usage Examples

```typescript
// Show the modal
setIsOpen(true);

// Hide the modal
setIsOpen(false);

// Render the modal with custom content
<Overlay isOpen={isOpen} setIsOpen={setIsOpen}>
  <p>This is the content of the modal.</p>
</Overlay>
```

### Important Notes

- The `Overlay` component uses inline styles to position and style the modal. Developers can customize the appearance of the modal by overriding these styles in their own CSS.
- The modal is positioned with `fixed` positioning and has a `z-index` of 999 to ensure it is displayed on top of other content.
- The modal content is wrapped in a scrollable container to allow for content that exceeds the available height.
