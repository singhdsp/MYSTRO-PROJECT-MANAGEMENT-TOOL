### `SelectTeam` Component

#### Purpose:
The `SelectTeam` component presents a modal dialog that allows users to select team members for a task or project.

#### Description:
This component fetches a list of team members from the server based on whether it's a task or project, filters the list based on a search term, and provides a user interface for selecting multiple team members. The selected members can then be saved and the modal dialog closed.

#### Parameters:
- `isOpen`: A boolean value that determines if the modal dialog is visible or hidden.
- `setIsOpen`: A function that sets the `isOpen` state, used to control the visibility of the modal dialog.
- `onClose`: A function to be executed when the modal dialog is closed.
- `team`: An optional array of pre-selected team members.
- `isTask`: A boolean value that determines if the modal dialog is being used to select team members for a task or project.
- `projectid`: An optional project ID used to fetch team members for a task.

#### Return Value:
The `SelectTeam` component returns a React component that renders the modal dialog.

#### Usage:

```javascript
import SelectTeam from "./SelectTeam";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
  const [selectedTeam, setselectedTeam] = useState([]);
  
  const handleOpen = () => setIsOpen(true);
  const handleClose = (selectedMembers) => {
     setselectedTeam(selectedMembers);
     setIsOpen(false);
     console.log(selectedMembers);
  };
  
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleOpen}>Open Select Team Modal</button>
      <SelectTeam isOpen={isOpen} onClose={handleClose} team={selectedTeam} />
    </>
  );
};
```

#### Important Notes:
- The component uses the `@mui/material` library for UI components.
- The component fetches team members from the server using the `getUsers` or `getUsersCreateTask` functions.
- The component uses the `useTranslations` hook from `next-intl` for localization.
- The component sets the `overflow` and `pointerEvents` styles of the document body to control the interaction with other elements while the modal dialog is open.
